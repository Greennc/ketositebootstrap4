bootstrap 4 website building

My previous site was made with bootstrap 3. Now I am utilizing 4 to take it to the next level. 
I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 4 to design and build this website. I learned a lot about photoshop standards and how they translate to the internet.  I am going to continue to add to this, as I made a kitchen measurement convertor with Javascript. 





(note as of this time the css is included in the stylesheet. Will be removing asap)
